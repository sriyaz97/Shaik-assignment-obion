## To build the "example-voting-app" application in the pipeline, push the built images to AWS ECR, perform dependency and image scans using Snyk, fix any security issues that may arise, and deploy the application to the Kubernetes cluster, you can follow these steps:

# Configure Jenkins with Git credentials:

- Ensure that Jenkins is configured with the necessary credentials to access your Git repository where the "example-voting-app" source code is located.
- Go to the Jenkins dashboard and navigate to "Manage Jenkins" > "Manage Credentials".
- Click on "Global credentials (unrestricted)" and then "Add Credentials".
- Select the appropriate credentials type for your Git repository (e.g., "Username with password" for Git username and password).
- Enter the Git repository URL, username, and password.
- Save the credentials.

#Update the Jenkins pipeline:
- Open the Jenkinsfile that defines your pipeline.
- Add stages to the pipeline for building, scanning, and deploying the application.
- Use the appropriate build tools and commands specific to your application and technology stack.
- Here's an example structure for the pipeline stages: pipeline.yaml
Note: Adjust the commands and configuration based on your specific application and environment.
- Save and commit the changes to your Jenkinsfile.
- Trigger the Jenkins pipeline to run, either manually or automatically based on your pipeline's configuration.

## The pipeline will clone the repository, build the application, perform dependency and image scans using Snyk, fix any security issues (if required), and deploy the application to the Kubernetes cluster using the provided Kubernetes manifest.

#To demonstrate the automatic execution of the pipeline when a change is made, follow these steps:
- Make a change to the "example-voting-app" application code.
- Commit the changes to your repository.
- Monitor the Jenkins pipeline, which should automatically start the pipeline execution upon detecting the code change.
- Verify that the pipeline builds the updated application, performs security scans, and deploys the new version to the Kubernetes cluster.
By following these steps, you will have a Jenkins pipeline that automatically builds, scans, and deploys the "example-voting-app" application in response to code changes, ensuring a streamlined and secure deployment process.


## For the 10th task, if the security scans break the pipeline, you can handle it by adding appropriate error handling and notification mechanisms. For example, you can use the catch block to catch failures in the dependency and image scans, and then send notifications or take specific actions to address the issues. The exact implementation will depend on the tools and integrations you have in place.

To demonstrate the automation in the 13th task, you can follow these steps:

- Make a change to the application code or configuration.
- Commit and push the changes to your repository (e.g., Git).
- Set up a webhook or configure Jenkins to poll the repository for changes.
- Once Jenkins detects the changes, it will automatically trigger the pipeline execution.
- Monitor the pipeline execution in the Jenkins console or dashboard.
- Review the logs and output to ensure that the pipeline progresses through the stages (build, dependency scan, image scan, deployment) without errors.
  Verify that the new version of the application is deployed to the Kubernetes cluster.
- You can also set up notifications or alerts to receive updates about the pipeline execution status.
Remember to adapt the Jenkinsfile and pipeline steps to match your specific environment, tools, and requirements.
