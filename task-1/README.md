5. Provide your payment information. Although the AWS Free Tier is free for eligible services within certain usage limits, you still need to provide payment information for verification purposes. AWS will not charge you unless you exceed the Free Tier usage limits or use services outside of the Free Tier. Select your payment method, enter the details, and click on "Verify and Add".

6. Select the type of account you want to create. You can choose between a personal account or an account for your organization. Follow the prompts to provide the necessary details.

8. You will receive an email from AWS asking you to verify your email address. Open the email and click on the verification link provided.

9. Set up your AWS Management Console password. Follow the instructions to create a password for your AWS account.

10. Choose a support plan. As a free tier user, you can select the "Free" plan, which provides basic support. You can upgrade to a paid support plan later if needed.

11. Complete the identity verification process. AWS may require additional information to verify your identity. Follow the instructions provided to complete this step.

12. Once your account is set up and verified, you can access the AWS Management Console using your email address and password.
